### Welcome Back Meeting

This meeting we talked about what the club is and what we do in the club. 

How to participate in competitions?

We will be sending 2 teams (should funding allow) to each competition. One team will be made up of participation within the club. This means showing up on Friday night and working with the team.

The Second team will be made up of the people committing to the projects we are working on, giving talks, and helping to teach people what they know to help them do better at competitions. More detail on this later.

We also held Elections this club meeting. The following are the results:
    President: 
    Vice President: 
    Secretary: 
    Treasurer: 
    Member at large: 

If you're seeing this before Friday, you know all my secrets.
