# EMU IASA First Fall 2019 Meeting!

## This meeting we talked about what the club is and what we do in the club
---

## What does IASA Do?
* We meet Friday nights at 5:30 and work on Cyber Security projects, training for competitions, and have people working in industry come in and give talks
* We host a Cyber Security Conference called YoloCon every year. This is our main fundraiser
* We compete in several competitions. We are also looking to add new competitions to this year's roster, some being online focused.
* A new oppertunity came this year, with IBM sponsoring us to host a Hack-A-Thon here at EMU. There are pretty big prizes for this competition. It will take place November 15th and 16th at either the Student Center or McKinney hall. 

### Competition Team Changes  
* The first team will be the same as last year. Attendance based team made from people who show up on Friday night. 

* The second team will be made up of people who help build projects and labs to train the club members. Helping to maintain this Github repo and adding value to projects, events, and other tasks will get you spots on this team.
